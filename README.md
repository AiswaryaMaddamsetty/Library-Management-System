# Library-Management-System
The Library Management System is a desktop application designed to manage book records, member registrations, book issuance, returns, and overdue tracking efficiently. It provides an intuitive interface for librarians to maintain the database, automate transactions, and generate reports seamlessly.
This project is designed in three layer structure:
***1. Presentation layer(Graphical user interface)***
***2. Business Logic Layer(contains the calculations and interacts with both GUI and Data access layer)***
***3. Data Acccess Layer(contains functions to interact with the database)***
